      hint: Rather than translate a vendor_template it is often better to use translations, like {{_ 'title'}}

          ## Instruction

          This is an *info* field.

          In general, a page like this is formed with field specs from a *vendortemplate* in the directory of the
          page being edited. Vendortemplates and childvendortemplates follow the same rules of how they are found
          as page templates. This means that one root vendortemplate can serve all similar subpages. In pages that
          are different, a special vendortemplate can be provided. 

          Vendortemplates are also language sensitive, like templates.
          In practice, it may be more parsimonious to relay on translation.txt files: labels and text fields allow
          Handlebars code (and Markdown) including the '_ i18n' helper.
      
          Also notice that this admin/edit page not only responds to language by default (if translations are provided),
          but also to the site theme.

          Here we will show some instruction in Markdown, where the syntax above indicates a 'literal block' in YAML.
          Note that you cannot use four dashes to indicate a horizontal rule,
          as this will split the field. Use the *line* type instead for that.

          Apart from the limitation above, you can put many things in an *info* field, including global variables,
          like {{siteurl}} and, say, images: ![Cats rule!](http://placekitten.com/50/50 "Kittens!") .

          Also, \\( {\sqrt{\alpha} \over \gamma} = \sum \beta_i \\) and other mathematical symbols and markup are available.
