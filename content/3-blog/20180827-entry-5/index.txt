Title: Make data.sitemap a real root

At the moment, we have data.pages to access the sitemap, but there are two problems with this:

 1. The top-level pages are called 'pages' and the lower-level pages are called 'children'. It seems better to use a consistent
    naming convention here, either 'pages' or 'children' throughout. It seems that 'children' is more consistent with other uses
    of 'child' (e.g., childtemplate) and we will use this then.

 2. A page has properties, one of which may be 'children'. Currently the data.sitemap only consists of children (called 'pages' now).
    This is not logical. We must remedy this and 

     - Remove data.pages and 
     - Move it to sitemap.children (replacing pages there)
     - Add the same properties to sitemap root as all pages in the sitemap have (url, path, ...)
