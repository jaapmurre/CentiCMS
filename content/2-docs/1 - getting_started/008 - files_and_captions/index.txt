Title: Files and captions

-----

Text:

The most straightforward way to add images and other files is to put them in the same directory as the index.txt file.

Suppose, I want to add a cool image to each blog entry. One way to accomplish this is to alter the childtemplate.txt
and add an image called 'image.jpg' to the template. Let's also use a Bootstrap card for some extra styling of the blog
entry, which will then look like this (not showing the side-bar):

    <!-- Blog Entry Column -->
    <div class="col-md-8">

      <h2 class="my-5">\{{page.title}}</h2>

      <div class="card mb-4">
        \{{#each page.files}}
          \{{#compare name '==' 'image.jpg'}}
            <img class="card-img-top" src="\{{url}}" alt="\{{caption.title}}">
            <small class="card-img-text text-right mr-3 mt-1">
              <i>\{{caption.attribution}}</i>
            </small>
          \{{/compare}}
        \{{/each}}
        <div class="card-body">
          <div class="card-text">
            \{{{markdown page.text}}}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

    </div>

We are making use of the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Card Component</a>,
used in the side-bar of blog entries as well. Additionally, we are showing an image and a 'caption.title' and 'caption.attribution'.
Each file that is not a functional CentiCMS file like index.txt or template.txt (etc.), but for examples images, sound files,
video files, PDFs, etc., can have an associated caption file that can hold arbitrary keyword-value pairs like an index.txt file.
A caption file is defined by adding .txt after whatever the name is of the file you want to caption. For example, the name of the
caption file for 'image.jpg' is 'image.jpg.txt', e.g.:

    title: Image caption

## Files

If you want to show images or present other files (sounds, video, documents),
you can add those in the folder where you want to use them. Files become
available in the templates in the 'files' variable. Each file has a type,
where the following file types are predefined

 - **image**: jpg, jpeg, gif, png, tif, tiff, svg, bmp
 - **document**: pdf, doc, docx, rtf, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx, csv, md
 - **video**: mov, mkv, avi, ogg, ogv, webm, flv, swf, mp4, mv4
 - **audio**: mp3, m4a, wav, aiff, midi

Each of the built-in types may be overriden in the config.txt file (see
below). Additionally, you can define your types by adding it with the prefix
'filetype_' to the config.txt file. For example, the add the new type 'math',
you can write:

    filetype_math: mat, spv, sav, r

This type is now available and in the template you can write stuff like:

    \{{#each files}}
      \{{#compare type '==' 'math'}}
          <a href="name">Download</a>
      \{{/compare}}
    \{{/each}}

### Files may be localized

Suppose, you have an image of a cartoon in English and a translated cartoon
image in Dutch. If you call the images cartoon.jpg and cartoon.nl.jpg
(assuming English as the default language), the Dutch cartoon image will
automatically be served.

### Caption files

Like page index.txt files, each file may have an associated 'caption file',
which must have the same name but the extension '.txt'. E.g., cartoon.jpg.txt
or cartoon.jpg.nl.txt for the Dutch version (not cartoon.nl.jpg.txt, the
language must come before '.txt');
