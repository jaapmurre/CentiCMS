Title: Styling text with Markdown

-----

Text:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a> is a popular way to add headers,
lists, and other elements to your texts.

Headers are added by starting a sentence with a #, like so:

    # Header

This will create a (big) level-1 header that looks like:

# Header

With two or more # characters you will get lower-level (smaller) headers, e.g.,

    ### A level-3 header

will look like:

### A level-3 header

    Any text that is written
    without empty ('white') lines
    between them will be considered
    as a single paragraph and rendered
    as flowing text.

    After a white line, a new paragraph
    starts. This looks like this when
    rendered:

Any text that is written
without empty ('white') lines
between them will be considered
as a single paragraph and rendered
as flowing text.

After a white line, a new paragraph
starts. This looks like this when
rendered:


Lists can be made with hyphens, much like you may improvise this in a plain text
editor:

     - List item 1
     - List item 2
     - List item 3

and this will be rendered like:

 - List item 1
 - List item 2
 - List item 3

The exact manner in which headers, lists and other elements are styled will depend on
the site theme you select.

Other things you can do is make words \*italic\*, \*\*strong\*\*, or \_underlined\_,
rendered like: *italic*, **strong**, or _underlined_.

There are many <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank">
more things you do with Markdown</a>, including inserting links, images, and tables. CentiCMS also adds
the capacity to use [mathematical formula in Markdown texts](../../selected_topics/mathematical_equations).

### Activating Markdown in a template.txt

By default, the texts you write in your index.txt files are not rendered as Markdown, you must make this
explicit in the template. This is done as follows:

    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark fixed-top">
        <!-- Nav bar code not shown for brevity -->
    </nav>

    <div class="container mt-4">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <h2>\{{page.title}}</h2>
          <div>
            <p>\{{{markdown page.text}}}</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

Notice two differences: (1) We have added the markdown 'helper'. This helper is added by CentiCMS to
Handlebars, giving it the capacity translate Markdown text to HTML code (using the
<a href="https://marked.js.org" target="_blank">marked parser</a>). (2) We are now using triple curly
braces, instead of double for the Markdown text. This is necessary because Handlebars removes all HTML tags
by default, i.e., when using the double curly braces. This is a safety feature, but since we control our
own text, it is unnecessary here. Tripling the braces ensures that the HTML is passed through,
so that it can be rendered in the browser.

If we now write:

text: \*\*Very\*\* interesting will be discussed here...

We will see Very appear as **Very**.

Our site still has only one page. Let's add some pages.
