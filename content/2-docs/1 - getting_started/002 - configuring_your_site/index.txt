Title: Configuring your site

-----

Text:

Part of the CentiCMS philosophy is to have batteries included, a lot of them in fact. In this case,
we can see the effect of that by changing the colors, fonts, and shapes to conform to one of over
twenty predefined 'site themes'. 

In order to communicate to CentiCMS that you wish to select a specific theme, you must first create
another file in the root, namely 'config.txt'. The root now looks like this:

    root/
      index.php
      content/
        template.txt
        config.txt

In the 'config.txt' file, you add a single line:

    sitetheme: cerulean

Now, if you check out your site, you will see the navigation bar is blue and all fonts have changed.
By changing the name of the theme in the 'config.txt' file, you can quickly style your site. Later,
you can then fine-tune the style or replace it with another one not already included.

The theme could be one of the bootswatch themes (check them out at https://bootswatch.com ):

 - default
 - cerulean
 - cosmo
 - cyborg
 - darkly
 - flatly
 - journal
 - litera
 - lumen
 - lux
 - materia
 - minty
 - pulse
 - sandstone
 - simplex
 - sketchy
 - slate
 - solar
 - spacelab
 - superhero
 - united
 - yeti

Another valid theme option is:

 - shards

which will use the Shards UI Toolkit to style your site (see https://designrevision.com/downloads/shards ).
