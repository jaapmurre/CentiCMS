## Getting started

Starting completely from scratch is not necessary because the standard Download of
CentiCMS includes a fully functioning, multi-lingual site. It is, however, instructive
to read along to see how to build-up a complete website starting from a single 
'index.php' file.

<ul class="list-group">
{{#each page.children}}
  <li class="list-group-item">
    {{#if isvisible}}
      <a href='{{url}}'>{{title}}</a>
    {{/if}}
  </li>
{{/each}}
</ul>
