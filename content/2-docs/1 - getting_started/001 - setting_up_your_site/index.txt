Title: Setting up your site

-----

Text:

### Folders (directories) and files

CentiCMS is a 'flat-file' content-management system (CMS), which means it does not use a database. This makes installing it very
easy. The very simplest install consists of a single file, namely the 'index.php' file, as follows:

    root/
      index.php

where root/ is the root of your website, often called 'www' or 'public_html' in the file system of your Internet hosting provider,
like SiteGround, Bluehost, or GoDaddy. The 'index.php' file contains all of the machinery to pull resources together and serve your site.

Then again, since you don't have a site yet, it won't show anything but just 'Loading...'.

To add contents you *must* include a content directory and place a file called 'template.txt' in it, like so:

    root/
      index.php
      content/
        template.txt

(Only things placed inside the content directory will be processed.)

Whatever you write in 'template.txt' will now appear as your root webpage. E.g., if you write 'Hello world!' as the only text
in the 'template.txt' file, you will see that text appear, instead of 'Loading...'.


### Bootstrap

CentiCMS already has written the necessary code to allow a website to be shown for the beginning and ending of the page,
where the text of template.txt will appear in the middle. The
default framework to help you layout your website in CentiCMS is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), which is already
preloaded.

Let's make a template that is a little more interesting. Replace 'Hello world!' with the following code:

    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark fixed-top">

      <div class="container">

        <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">My Site</a>

        <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse"
                data-target="#navbarCollapse" aria-controls="navbarCollapse"
                aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
          <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
        </button>

        <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarCollapse">
          <ul class="navbar-nav mr-auto">
            <li class="nav-item active">
              <a class="nav-link" href="#">Home <span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="#">About Us</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="#">Contact</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      </div>

    </nav>

    <div class="container mt-4">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <h2>My site is awesome!</h2>
          <div>
            <p>Here, very interesting things will be discussed.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

If you now inspect your site, it will look much more professional. At the Bootstrap site there are
more [getting-started examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/), which you can copy and
paste into your template. (Click right and select 'View Page Source' and remember that you only need
to copy the code between the body tags. Sometimes, you will also need to copy a few styles in a so
called .css stylesheet. We will cover this later in the documentation.)

As yo can see, it is quite a lot of code, but then again it does a lot too. For example, try to make your webpage
really narrow, like on a cell phone. At some point of 'narrowness', the menu disappears and is replaced
by a three-bars icon that opens up a vertical menu if you click on it. This is Bootstrap at work.

The code is written in HTML, the Hyper-Text Markup Language, with which you tell the browser what it
should display on your web pages and what its role is (header, image, emphasis, table cell, etc.).
Bootstrap adds quite a few additional elements and utilities, typically through classes, like
`class="container"`.

Once you have defined a template, you can use it for all your pages. How? The content, such as the page title,
main text and images or other files, are kept separate from the template.

### FAQ

#### It says Bootstrap is already preloaded, but I do not see the files anywhere. Where are they?

All 'preloaded' files are loaded from free public repositories, so called CDNs.
