## [Developers Manual]({{page.url}}/developers_manual)

Gives details about how developers can create third-party add-ons for CentiCMS,
which are called *vendor plugins*.


## Setting up your site

There is no database, as CentiCMS is a 'flat-file', meaning it does not use a database. This makes installing it very
easy. The simplest install consists of the following:

    root/
      index.php

where root/ is the root of your website, often called 'www' or 'public_html' at the site of your Internet hosting provider,
like Bluehost or GoDaddy.

## Templates

CentiCMS uses Kirby's smart directory based organization of pages and subpages but  instead of putting page templates in
a separate directory, they are put in the same one, always called 'template.txt'. If that file does not exist and the
directory above has a file called 'childtemplate.txt', then that is used. This is helpful for collection pages like a
blog overview page with blog entries, or a project collection page with project subpages, etc. If none of these is
present, the default template (always called 'template.txt' as are all templates) in the 'content' root is used. A
fourth possibility is to specify:

     Template: about

which tells the system to look for a template file in the about folder. If this is specified it overrides all other options.








### site.txt

Use of this file is completely optional and may include any variable you want.

### partials.txt


## Multi-lingual sites

Each of the above files, except config.txt, can be localized by adding '.nl',
where '.nl' (= Dutch) is one of the language defined in your config.txt:

    languages: en, nl

The first language, here 'en' (English), is the default language and it is
used for files without a language code. So, we can have an index.nl.txt as a
Dutch translation of an index.txt file (index.en.txt would also be allowed).
But also template.txt, site.txt.

This covers nearly all translation needs. Additionially, you may add files
'translation.txt' and 'translation.nl.txt', one for each language, with
entries as above, e.g., to store words that may be used in many parts of your
site, such as:

    slogan: CentiCMS: 1% grootte, ongelofelijke kracht

You can refer to these as translation.slogan etc. or use the _ helper.

    { {_ slogan}}
