Title: config.txt

----

Text:

This file contains a limited set of key-value pairs that are hard-coded via
PHP. That means these values are included in the file before it is served to
the client-side browser. This is an easy mechanism to specify additional style
sheets, javascript and other aspects you want to use and that were not already
included.

Use of the config.txt file is optional and may be left out. However, I suggest
you leave it in and at least fill out the sitename of your site, which will be
hard-coded in the html file. Though optional here, it is important for
Google and the others to find and index your site properly:

 - sitename

 - siteurl: http://localhost/centicms

 - remove_from_route: centicms


Valid additional (optional) options:

 - languages

   A comma-separated list of languages, e.g.,

       languages: en,nl

   The first language, by convention, is the *default language*. If nothing else is specified, it
   will be assumed. You may also use more specific identifiers, e.g., 

        languages: en_nz, nl_be

   If you are going to work with dates and times and use the preloaded [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/) library,
   you may want to check there, whether a particular language code is supported. If specified with the 'languages'
   key, the required files will be loaded automatically for Moment.js.

 - theme

     This could be one of the bootswatch themes (see https://bootswatch.com ):

     - default
     - cerulean
     - cosmo
     - cyborg
     - darkly
     - flatly
     - journal
     - litera
     - lumen
     - lux
     - materia
     - minty
     - pulse
     - sandstone
     - simplex
     - sketchy
     - slate
     - solar
     - spacelab
     - superhero
     - united
     - yeti

    Another valid theme option is:

     - shards

    which will use the Shards UI Toolkit to style your site (see https://designrevision.com/downloads/shards ).

 - icons

   Valid values are:

    - fontawesome (default, see https://fontawesome.com )
    - material (see https://material.io/tools/icons )
    - none (if you don't want to use fonts and don't want the overhead of an icon font)
 
You can also specify the stylesheets and javascript in full yourself with

 - stylesheet
 - javascript

The stylesheet value must include all the markup that make it valid, e.g., 

    stylesheet: 

    <link rel='stylesheet' href='full_path_to_my_stylesheet.css'>

You can also enter local styles. Adding several ones is allowed. 

You can directly enter some meta tag info with

 - meta_description
 - meta_author
 - meta_keywords (but see warning against its use at https://blog.realmacsoftware.com/which-meta-tags-matter-for-seo-in-2018/ )

You can specify styles in full (you must include the `<style></style>` tags) with

 - style

For example,

    <style>
        .scream: {
            color: red; 
            font-size: 4em;
        }
    </style>

and similarly with meta tags, if you want to use meta-tages other than description, author, and keywords:

 - metatags



 - mathjax: true

 - extra_sitemap_fields: color

 - filetype_math: sav, spv, mat, r
