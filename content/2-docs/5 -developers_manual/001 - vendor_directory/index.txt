Title: Vendor Directory

----

Text:

A new third-party plugin or add-on, called *vendor plugin* in CentiCMS, is always
placed in the 'vendor' directory, which is at the same level as the 'content'
directory:

    content/
    vendor/
    index.php
    .access

Suppose, any new plugin **has** to placed in the vendor directory in its own
subdirectory, e.g.,

    content/
    vendor/
      myplugin/
    index.php
    .access

This 'myplugin' directory can be viewed as the 'root' of the plugin. In it, you may
place a content directory which will be searched an integrated with the rest of the
website. That means that any files in the content directory will be found and its
content processed and made available to the page and sitemap like the normal
content directory. 

One of the simplest types of vendor plugins is to provide a translation, for example,
in a new language not previous available, e.g., Dutch (.nl):

    content/
    vendor/
      myplugin_nl/
        content/
          translation.nl.txt
    index.php
    .access

If the original content directory does not yet have this file, it is now available.

Note, that if translation.nl.txt were placed directly in myplugin, it would not be found.
But it is (therefore) a good place to put any PHP files that must do some processing on 
the server.

To add 'nl' to the available languages, we can add it with a config.txt file:

    content/
    vendor/
      myplugin_nl/
        content/
          translation.nl.txt
          config.txt
    index.php
    .access

where 'config.txt' only has one line:

    languages: nl

The language field has the characteristic that any config.txt keyword-value pairs in vendor files
will be added to it. Some other fields have this characteristic as well and this collection can 
be extended with a config setting.
